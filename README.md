# Introduction
Based on Allan Gurwicz's (@agurwicz) method of installing Python and his orignal Python scripts.

This method skips the ugliness of dealing with Anaconda for a barebones approach.  If you already have worked with environments, this method is likely as easy, or easier, than dealing with Anaconda.

## Why Use This Method?
- Anaconda can often hang up trying to resolve packages.  It can take hours or more and can fail even after all that.
- It allows you to rapidly create, update, and delete environments and Python versions.
